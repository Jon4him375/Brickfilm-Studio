# Brickfilm-Studio
Created about 6 years as I was learning C#. I was interested in stopmotion animation at the time, so I centered the project on that. It creates a project and adds it to a tree where you can then create a "scene", which allows you to then create/edit/delete multiple sub-items (shots, actions, etc.). The progress is saved in the file system where you can see it again even after the program is closed. The code is extremely messy and I would totally change the entire project structure if I did it again (again, I was a beginner when writing), but it really helped me along as I learned C#.
